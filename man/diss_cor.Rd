\title{Dissimilarity Index Combining Temporal Correlation and Raw Values}
\usage{
diss_cor(SERIES, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{SERIES}{data}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
The computed distance.
}
\description{
Computes an adaptive dissimilarity index between two time series that covers both dissimilarity on
raw values and dissimilarity on temporal correlation behaviors.
}
\details{
dissimilarity measures based on the Pearson correlation factor between two series
